### **Scope of the Project: Desktop-Style Portfolio**

#### **Objective**:

Create a portfolio that mimics a desktop environment, complete with a taskbar, icons, and interactive "windows," offering a unique user experience.

---

### **Features**

#### **1. Desktop Interface**

- **Background**: A customizable desktop background (solid color or wallpaper).
- **Icons**: Desktop-style icons representing different sections of your portfolio (e.g., “About Me,” “Projects,” “Contact”).
- **Double Click Interaction**: Clicking an icon opens the corresponding section in a new "window."

---

#### **2. Taskbar**

- **Start Menu**: A button or menu that lists all sections of the site.
- **Time and Date**: Display the current time and date.
- **Open Windows**: Show minimized or active "windows" in the taskbar.

---

#### **3. Windows**

- Each portfolio section (e.g., About, Projects, Contact) opens as a resizable and draggable "window."
- **Features**:
    - Maximize, minimize, and close buttons.
    - Responsive layout within the windows.

---

#### **4. About Section**

- A window that opens to display:
    - A brief introduction.
    - Your skills and interests.
    - Fun, interactive design elements (e.g., hover effects).

---

#### **5. Projects Section**

- Opens as a separate "window" showing:
    - A list of projects with thumbnails and descriptions.
    - Links to live demos and repositories.
    - Optional: Clicking a project opens a new "window" with detailed information.

---

#### **6. Contact Section**

- A window with:
    - A contact form (name, email, and message).
    - Links to your social media profiles.
    - Option to download your resume.

---

### **Design Guidelines**

- **Color Palette**: Choose a clean, professional color palette reminiscent of operating systems.
- **Icons**: Use flat or minimalistic desktop icons.
- **Window Design**: Mimic the style of desktop windows, complete with borders and controls (minimize, maximize, close).
- **Fonts**: Use system-style fonts for a realistic look.

---

### **Technologies to Use**

- **HTML/CSS**: For layout and styling (use `z-index` for layering windows).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (drag-and-drop windows, taskbar functionality).
- Optional:
    - **Frameworks**: React for managing components like windows and icons.
    - **Libraries**: Use libraries like jQuery UI or interact.js for drag-and-drop functionality.

---

### **Stretch Goals**

- **Customizable Desktop**: Allow users to change the background or theme.
- **Save State**: Use local storage to remember open windows or settings.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions for opening and closing windows.
- **Easter Eggs**: Fun surprises hidden in the design.
